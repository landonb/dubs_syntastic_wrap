" About:

" A simple wrapper around Syntastic.
"
" In a window, type Ctrl-e to run Syntastic on the buffer
" and open the location list if their are errors, and type
" Ctrl-e again to close the location list.

" *** Syntax Checkers.
"
" For complete list, see:
"   https://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic/wiki/Syntax-Checkers
" What's configured here is for dubsacks, i.e., based on [lb]'s
" preferences and experience with different projects (e.g., not
" all projects will lint cleanly).
" You may want to tweak this for yourself.
" MAYBE: Move the config from here to the style_guard and let it
"        change with each project. Ya know, a virtualenv for Vim.

" The default Python checker is 'pylint'. But if you're looking at
" a project that doesn't conform to today's best practices, the output
" will likely make you cry. So instead, use just the basic Python
" executable and check basic syntax.
" FIXME: Configure this on a pre-project basis...
"        maybe using a .dubsrc file in the hierarchy?
" Python checkers: flake8, frosted, mypy, pep257, pep8, prospector,
"                  py3kwarn, pyflakes, pylama, pylint, python
let g:syntastic_python_checkers = ['python']

" Js default is empty because there's standard Linux JavaScript engine.
" jslint can be very complaining if your code isn't the most compliant,
" so we just jshint just to check syntax.
" FIXME: Again, use a .dubsrc file or something to configure per-project...
"        or does syntastic have some similar way of per-project configuring?
"
" JavaScript checkers: closurecompiler, eslint, flow, gjslint (Closure Linter),
"                      jscs, jshint, jsl, jslint, jsxhint
"let g:syntastic_javascript_checkers = ['jslint']
let g:syntastic_javascript_checkers = ['jshint']
" It's not necessary to set the path like this:
"  let g:syntastic_javascript_jshint_exec = "/usr/local/bin/jshint"

" MAYBE: reStructuredText: rst2pseudoxml, rstcheck
" MAYBE: css checker: csslint, phpcs, prettycss, recess
" MAYBE: html checker: jshint, tidy, validator*, w3* 
" MAYBE: less checker: lessc, recess
" MAYBE: sass checker: sass, sassc
" MAYBE: handlebars checker: handlebars
" MAYBE: json checker: jsonlint, jsonval
" MAYBE: bash checker: bashate, checkbashisms, sh, shellcheck

" Disable style messages (see :help syntastic_quiet_messages):
"let g:syntastic_quiet_messages = { "type": "style" }

" To navigate errors, try :help :lnext and :help :lprev.

" Dubsacks Syntastic Mappings
" ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

" In Vim, you can map Ctrl-Shift-to special keys and numbers,
" but not to alphabet characters, so we could map Syntastic
" show/hide to two separate Ctrl-<letter> commands, or we
" could just use a toggler and map it to one.
